Developed a Text to SQL LangGraph Agent which outputs a Generated SQL Query and Query Result as shown in result.png File, and Query result is interpreted in Natural Language.

The architecture of our LangGraph-based SQL agent. Here's a breakdown of the components:

Start: The entry point of our graph.
generate_sql: This node takes the user's natural language query and generates a SQL query.
should_continue: This is a decision node that determines the next step based on the current state.
execute_sql: This node executes the generated SQL query on the database.
interpret_result: This node interprets the SQL query results in natural language.
End: The final node where the process terminates.

The flow of the graph is as follows:

The process starts at the "Start" node and immediately moves to the "generate_sql" node.
After generating the SQL, the flow moves to the "should_continue" decision node.
The "should_continue" node has three possible paths:

If there's no result yet, it goes to "execute_sql".
If the result is a SELECT query, it also goes to "execute_sql".
In all other cases, it goes to "interpret_result".


If it goes to "execute_sql", it then loops back to "should_continue" to decide the next step.
If it goes to "interpret_result", it then proceeds to the "End" node.

This graph structure allows for flexibility in handling different scenarios:

It can generate and execute a SQL query, then interpret the results all in one pass.
It can also handle cases where multiple SQL queries might be needed (e.g., if the first query doesn't fully answer the user's question).

The "should_continue" node acts as a control flow mechanism, ensuring that the graph can adapt to different query types and results. This makes our SQL agent more robust and capable of handling a variety of user queries.
